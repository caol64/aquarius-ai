# AquariusAI

The design philosophy of `AquariusAI` is centered around making it easier for you to utilize a variety of open-source models, assisting in enhancing the efficiency of daily work and improving quality of life. It also addresses concerns about privacy leaks and cost associated with using commercial models. `AquariusAI` does not provide any AI models itself; thus, users need to prepare their own models.
