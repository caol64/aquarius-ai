# AquariusAI

English | [中文](README_zh.md)

`AquariusAI` is a macOS client designed to make it more convenient for you to use "open-source AI models," addressing concerns about privacy leaks and cost associated with proprietary models. `AquariusAI` does not provide any "AI models" itself; you need to prepare the required models on your own.

## Features

- Text-to-Text
  - Work with all `Ollama` models (`Llama 3`, `Phi 3`, `Mistral`, `Gemma 2` etc.)
  - Supports `knowledge base` and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (`RAG`)
- Text-to-Image
  - For `CoreML` format `Stable Diffusion` models (including `XL` models)
  - AI Upscaling

And more...

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 Sonoma or later.
